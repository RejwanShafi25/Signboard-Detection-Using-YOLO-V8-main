# Signboard Detection Using YOLO V8
 Here We have built a custom object detection model using YOLO V8, as part of my coursework for CSE428 (Image Processing). Our object detection model is used to detect signboard in images.

For this project we used a local dataset, which consisted around six to 7 thousand sign board images, all the images were captured in Bangladesh. The dataset, were not divided into train, validation and test split, We had to split the dataset into threee splits. Adter Training out model we achived an overall acurracy of
